  	<h3>Who is DevOps?</h3>
  	<p>DevOps is a software development method that emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and other IT professionals.</p>
  	<p>It is a growing discipline that sits at the crossroad of Development, QA, and Delivery. Wide ranging technical and social strategies are used to streamline and automate the work needed to get code from developers to the customer's hands.</p>
